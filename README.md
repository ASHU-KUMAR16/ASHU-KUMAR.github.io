"Welcome to my digital collection. This site serves as a living archive of verses—some written in the quiet of midnight, others in the rush of the morning. Here, words are more than just ink; they are mirrors."

Poem 1: The Digital Echo (Modern/Tech Theme)
Use this to show off a "Dark Mode" or modern design.

The cursor blinks, a rhythmic heart, In spaces where the stanzas start. No paper tears, no ink to bleed, Just pixels planted like a seed. A poem lives in lines of code, Upon this silicon-paved road.

Poem 2: The Unwritten (Short/Minimalist)
Use this for a "Minimalist" section.

The loudest song Is the one Still trapped Behind your teeth.
